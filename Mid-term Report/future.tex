\section{Going forward}

Given our findings and results we will do BLAGAHFDASGASGS. Based on these changes our updated milestones are as follows.
\subsection{Milestones}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transfer Learning Labels(March 28): Using finding from data exploration and clustering we will create processed data to be used with our transfer tasks.
    \item Synonym Evaluation dataset and Baselines(March 28th): Finalize query synonym prediction task and produce baselines that do not leverage click data.
    \item Query Rewriting baseline(March 28): Finalize query rewriting task and produce baselines that do not leverage click data.
    \item Midterm Report(March 30): Discuss progress and learning.
    \item Experiments across tasks(April 15th): Initial results using transfer data on benchmark tasks. Use results to go back and tweak mining methods.
    \item Experiments across tasks v2(April 30): Updated results using improved data.
    \item Final report (May 5th)
\end{enumerate}
